# Low Profile Memory Scanner (LPMS)

LPMS is a light-weight memory scanner for the Windows operating system. It gives users the ability to scan, disassemble and debug the memory space of another application. 

LPMS was sold online to hundreds of customers world-wide. This product was maintained throughout my high-school years until I graduated. I had discontinued it so that I could focus on my university studies. 

## Usage

The memory scanner is a dynamic link library (DLL). This is because DLLs in Windows are adept to evasive reverse-engineering processes than a standalone application. 

To use LPMS, you must inject this library into the target application's memory space. I have provided several DLL injecters in my GitHub repository.
