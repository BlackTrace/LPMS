LPMS (Low Profile Memory Scanner)

  I developped the Memory Engine with C++ while I was still a junior in high school. You may find instances in the source-code 
that could be improved on. I didn't have the time to refurbish the source-code after its release since I didn't get a chance.

  Watch out for the license-check at the main entry-point of every sub-project within the project. The Memory Engine itself is 
a DLL so in order to launch it you need to inject it into your target application.
